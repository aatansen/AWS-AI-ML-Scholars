# **Strategic Guidance for Security, Governance, and Compliance**

## Concepts of security, governance, and compliance in organizations

Security, governance, and compliance might seem like the same function. The following are examples of the primary goals of each:

- **Security:** Ensure that confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained for organizational data and information assets and infrastructure. This function is often called information security or cybersecurity in an organization.
- **Governance:** Ensure that an organization can add value and manage risk in the operation of business.
- **Compliance:** Ensure normative adherence to requirements across the functions of an organization.

Organizations implement security, governance, and compliance functions to assure that they can deliver on their primary business. Sometimes the requirements for these functions are referred to as the *most important requirements*, or the things that must not be sacrificed in product development or delivery.

## Defense in depth

## Defense in depth for AI on AWS

This course focuses on one of the most common paradigms, known as defense in depth, that organizations follow to integrate their security, governance, and compliance functions while building on AWS. Here are some features of a defense in depth security strategy:

- A defense in depth security strategy uses multiple redundant defenses to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, data, and assets. It helps make sure that if any one security control is compromised or fails, additional layers exist to help isolate threats and prevent, detect, respond, and recover from security events.
- Applying a defense in depth security strategy to generative AI workloads, data, and information can help create the best conditions to achieve business objectives. Defense-in-depth security mitigates many of the common risks that any workload faces by layering controls, helping teams govern generative AI workloads using familiar tools.
- You can use a combination of strategies, including AWS and AWS Partner services and solutions, at each layer to improve the security and resiliency of your generative AI workloads.

# **Applying Governance and Compliance for AI Systems**

## Compliance Standards for AI Systems

### The importance of governance and compliance for AI systems

Following are points that explain the advantages of governance and compliance:

- Managing, optimizing, and scaling the organizational AI initiative is at the core of the governance perspective. Incorporating AI governance into an organization’s AI strategy is instrumental in building trust. Governance also helps in enabling the deployment of AI technologies at scale, and overcoming challenges to drive business transformation and growth.
- Governance and compliance are important for AI systems used in business to ensure responsible and trustworthy AI practices. As AI systems become more prevalent in decision-making processes, it is essential to have robust governance frameworks and compliance measures in place to mitigate risks. These risks include bias, privacy violations, and unintended consequences.
- Governance helps organizations establish clear policies, guidelines, and oversight mechanisms to ensure AI systems align with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to ethical principles and societal values. Therefore, governance protects the organization from potential legal and reputational risks. It also fosters public trust and confidence in the responsible deployment of AI technologies within the business context.

### AWS compliance

AWS compliance empowers customers to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and data protection in the AWS Cloud. AWS supports 143 security standards and compliance certifications.

Typically, customers decide their own tolerance for risk. The following are some specific security standards that might apply to AI systems.

- **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**: The NIST 800-53 security controls are commonly used for U.S. federal information systems. Federal information systems typically need to undergo a formal evaluation and approval process to verify they have adequate safeguards in place to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information and information systems.
- **European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)**:European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) contributes to the EU’s cyber policy. It boosts trust in digital products, services, and processes by drafting cybersecurity certification schemes. It cooperates with EU countries and bodies and helps prepare for future cyber challenges.
- **International Organization for Standardization (ISO)**:ISO is a security standard that outlines recommended security management practices and comprehensive security controls, based on the guidance provided in the ISO/IEC 27002 best practice document.
- **AWS System and Organization Controls (SOC)**: The AWS System and Organization Controls (SOC) Reports are independent assessments conducted by third parties that show how AWS has implemented and maintained key compliance controls and objectives.
- **Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)**: AWS empowers covered entities and their business associates under the U.S. HIPAA regulations to use the secure AWS environment for processing, maintaining, and storing protected health information.
- **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**: The European Union's GDPR safeguards the fundamental right of EU citizens to privacy and the protection of their personal information. The GDPR establishes stringent requirements that raise and unify the standards for data protection, security, and compliance across the EU.
- **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**: The PCI DSS is a private information security standard that is managed by the PCI Security Standards Council. This council was established by a group of major credit card companies, including American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, Mastercard, and Visa.

### AI standards compliance

AI standards compliance influences how organizations follow established guidelines, rules, and legal requirements that govern the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies.

There are several key ways in which AI standards compliance differs from traditional software and technology requirements. The following are some issues to consider.

- **Complexity and opacity**: AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, can be highly complex with opaque decision-making processes. This makes it challenging to audit and understand how they arrive at outputs, which is crucial for compliance.
- **Dynamism and adaptability**: AI systems are often dynamic and can adapt and change over time, even after deployment. This makes it difficult to apply static standards, frameworks, and mandates.
- **Emergent capabilities**: Emergent capabilities in AI systems refer to unexpected or unintended capabilities that arise as a result of complex interactions within the AI system, in contrast to capabilities that are explicitly programmed or designed.

  As AI systems become more advanced, they might exhibit unexpected or emergent capabilities that were not anticipated during the regulatory process. This requires ongoing monitoring and adaptability.

- **Unique risks**: AI poses novel risks, such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, misinformation, and AI-powered automation displacing human workers. Traditional requirements might not adequately address these.

  Algorithmic bias refers to the systematic errors or unfair prejudices that can be introduced into the outputs of AI and machine learning (ML) algorithms. The following are some examples:

  - **Biased training data:** If the data used to train the AI model is not representative or contains historical biases, the model can learn and perpetuate those biases in its outputs.
  - **Human bias:** The biases and assumptions of the human developers and researchers who create the AI systems can also get reflected in the final outputs.

- **Algorithm accountability**: Algorithm accountability refers to the idea that algorithms, especially those used in AI systems, should be transparent, explainable, and subject to oversight and accountability measures. These safeguards are important because algorithms can have significant impacts on individuals and society. They can potentially perpetuate biases or make decisions that violate human rights or the principles of responsible AI.

  Examples of algorithm accountability laws include the European Union's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which includes provisions for transparency, risk assessment, and human oversight of AI systems. In the United States, several states and cities have also passed laws related to algorithm accountability, such as New York City's Automated Decision Systems Law.

  The goal of these laws is to ensure that AI systems are designed and used in a way that respects human rights, promotes fairness and non-discrimination, and upholds the principles of responsible AI.

### Regulated workloads

**What is a regulated workload?**

*Regulated* is a common term used to indicate that a workload might need special consideration, because of some form of compliance that must be achieved.

This term often refers to customers who work in industries with high degrees of regulatory compliance requirements or high industrial demands.

Some example industries are as follows:

- Financial services
- Healthcare
- Aerospace

More regulated workloads:

- **Data regulation and governance**: You can be sure that you’re operating in a regulated context when you must comply with regulatory frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, and others.
- **Expected impacts and usage**: An example of a regulated process would be reporting to a US federal agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

  An example of regulated outcomes or decisions would be mortgage and credit applications.

  An example of regulated usage would be a safety-critical system. If a workload fails, then there could be safety implications.

  Regulated liabilities are related to AI models. If the model fails, there are significant liabilities.

- **Industry standards and guidelines**:Industry standards and guidelines require you to meet the bar for their industrial practice, which might not be specifically a legal compliance framework. HIPAA is and example of this, but it still could have detailed governance and policy implications.

**Example regulated workloads**: Example workloads that are regulated or that need to be handled as though they are regulated include the following:

- HR workloads
- Safety workloads
- Inspection and regulatory compliance workloads

---

### Which indicators tell you that your workload might be regulated?

You are operating in a regulated context when you must comply with regulatory frameworks such as HIPAA, GDPR, PCI DSS, and others.

You can realize your data needs by determining if such standards exist or apply. Ask the following questions.

**Questions to ask**:

- Do you need to audit this workload?
- Do you need to archive this data for a period of time?
- Will the predictions created by my model constitute a record or other special data item?
- Do any of the systems you get the data from contain data classifications that are restricted by your organization’s governance, but not a regulatory framework? For example, customer addresses.

# **Securing AI Systems**

## Security and Privacy Considerations for AI Systems

### Security considerations

In the context of AI and generative AI, there are a number of security tasks, such as threat detection, vulnerability management, infrastructure protection, prompt injection, and data encryption. Following is a description of each of these tasks.

- **Threat detection**: To detect threats to your AI systems, do the following:

  - Identify and monitor for potential security threats, such as malicious actors attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in AI systems or using generative AI for malicious purposes. The following are some examples:
    - Generating fake content
    - Manipulating data
    - Automating attacks
  - You can assist threat detection by developing and deploying AI-powered threat detection systems. You can analyze network traffic, user behavior, and other data sources to detect and respond to potential threats.

  For more information, see Threat Detection and Protect Against Adversarial and Malicious Activities.

- **Vulnerability management**: To help manage vulnerability, do the following:

  - Identify and address vulnerabilities in AI and generative AI systems, including software bugs, model weaknesses, and potential attack vectors (for example, malware, viruses, and email attachments).
  - Regularly conduct security assessments, penetration testing (attempt to find and exploit vulnerabilities), and code reviews to uncover and address vulnerabilities.
  - Implement robust patch management and update processes to ensure that AI systems are kept up to date and secure.

  For more information, see Vulnerability Management.

- **Infrastructure protection**: To ensure that your infrastructure is protected, do the following:

  - Secure the underlying infrastructure that supports AI and generative AI systems, such as the following:
    - Cloud computing platforms
    - Edge devices
    - Data stores
  - Implement strong access controls, network segmentation, encryption, and other security measures to protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access and attacks.
  - Ensure that the AI infrastructure is resilient and can withstand failures, attacks, or other disruptions.

  For more information, see Infrastructure Protection.

- **Prompt injection**: You need to mitigate the risk of prompt injection attacks. In these attacks, adversaries attempt to manipulate the input prompts of generative AI models to generate malicious or undesirable content. To reduce the risk, do the following:

  - Employ techniques, such as prompt filtering, sanitization, and validation, to ensure that the input prompts are safe and do not contain malicious content.
  - Develop robust models and training procedures that are resistant to prompt injection attacks.

  For more information, see Protect Against Data Poisoning Threats.

- **Data encryption**: To protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data used to train and deploy AI and generative AI models, do the following:

  - Implement strong encryption mechanisms to secure both data at rest and data in transit. Data at rest refers to data that is stored on servers, in databases, or on local devices. Data in transit refers to data that is transmitted during communication between different components of the AI system.
  - Ensure that the encryption keys are properly managed and protected from unauthorized access.

  For more information, see Data Protection and  Protect Sensitive Data Privacy.

### The AWS Shared Responsibility Model

Security and compliance is a shared responsibility between AWS and the customer. The shared model helps relieve the customer’s operational burden. AWS operates, manages, and controls the host operating system and virtualization layer down to the physical security of the facilities in which the service operates.

The customer assumes responsibility and management of the guest operating system. This includes updates, security patches, and other associated application software, in addition to the configuration of the AWS provided security group firewall. 

Customers should carefully consider the services they choose. Their responsibilities vary, depending on the services used, the integration of those services into their IT environment, and applicable laws and regulations. The nature of this shared responsibility also provides the flexibility and customer control that permits the deployment. 

As shown in the following chart, this differentiation of responsibility is commonly referred to as security of the cloud compared to security in the cloud.

![responsibilities of the customer and AWS](https://i.imgur.com/M5DgAST.png)

- **1. Customer**: A customer's responsibility will be determined by the AWS Cloud services that a customer selects. This determines the amount of configuration work the customer must perform as part of their security responsibilities.
- **2. Customer responsibility**: Customers are responsible for the following:

  - Customer data
  - Platform, applications, identity and access management
  - Operating system, network and firewall configuration
  - Client-side data encryption and data integrity authentication
  - Server-side encryption (including file system and data)
  - Networking traffic protection (including encryption, integrity, identity)

- **3. AWS responsibility**: AWS is responsible for protecting the infrastructure that runs all of the services offered in the AWS Cloud. This infrastructure is composed of the hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS Cloud services.
- **4. AWS software responsibility**: AWS is responsible for software, including compute, storage, database, and networking.
- **5. AWS hardware responsibility**: AWS is responsible for hardware and AWS Global Infrastructure, including Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations.

### AWS services for securing AI systems

Defense in depth security

Recall that the defense in depth was briefly described at the beginning of this course. The goal of this strategy is to provide multiple layers of security around your data and workloads.

If one layer is compromised, the other layers will isolate, slow down, or stop a threat actor. The multiple layers prevent the threat actor from moving laterally, escalating privileges, exfiltrating or manipulating data, and so on.

---
[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Getting started with defense in depth

There are four foundational AWS security services recommended for any workload, any customer, and any industry. You can realize benefits from implementing these deeply-integrated foundational security services, such as the following:

- Security Hub
- AWS KMS
- GuardDuty
- AWS Shield Advanced

Each service provides protection in one of the core security domains of incident response, data protection, threat detection, and network and application protection.

- **AWS Security Hub**: AWS Security Hub provides customers with a single dashboard to view all security findings, and to create and run automated playbooks.
- **AWS KMS**: AWS KMS encrypts data and gives customers the choice and control of using AWS managed keys or customer-managed keys to protect their data.
- **Amazon GuardDuty**: Amazon GuardDuty is a threat detection service that monitors for suspicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect AWS accounts, workloads, and data.
- **AWS Shield Advanced**: AWS Shield Advanced helps protect workloads against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) events. AWS Shield Advanced includes AWS WAF and AWS Firewall Manager.

### AWS security services

AWS provides several services and features for securing AI systems. The following services are used to manage user identities and access to resources, identify and protect sensitive data, and guard your AI systems and applications.

- **Identify sensitive data before training models**: Amazon Macie uses ML to automate sensitive data discovery at scale.

  You can use Amazon Macie to scan S3 buckets for personally identifiable information (PII), personal health information (PHI), financial information, and other sensitive data. You can determine whether you need to remove the data or whether it needs more security protections before training or fine-tuning models.

  You can also scan databases by extracting data to a data lake in Amazon S3 to then have Amazon Macie scan the database content.

  For more information, see the Amazon Macie User Guide

- **Manage identities and access to AWS services and resources**: With AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), you can specify who or what can access services and resources in AWS. You can also centrally manage fine-grained permissions, and analyze access to refine permissions across AWS. Here are some IAM entities that you can create:

  - **IAM users and IAM user groups:** An IAM user is an entity that you create in AWS. The IAM user represents the human user or workload who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials. An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users. User groups let you specify permissions for multiple users, which can make it more convenient to manage the permissions for those users.
  - **IAM roles:** An IAM role is an IAM identity that you can create in your account that has specific permissions. An IAM role is similar to an IAM user, in that it is an AWS identity with permission policies that determine what the identity can and cannot do in AWS.
  - **IAM policies:** A policy is an entity that, when attached to an identity or resource, defines their permissions.

  For more information, see AWS Identity and Access Management and the AWS Identity and Access Management User Guide.

- **Limit access to your data, models, and outputs**: Apply a policy of least privilege to training data, models, and applications using AWS IAM Identity Center and IAM Access Analyzer. Here are some other services you can use to limit access:

  - Explore further zero trust capabilities to add fine-grained access controls with AWS Verified Access and Amazon Verified Permissions.
  - Use AWS Verified Access to further eliminate the costs, complexity and performance issues related to virtual private networks (VPNs).

  You can use Amazon SageMaker Role Manager to build and manage persona-based IAM roles for common ML needs.

  Amazon SageMaker Role Manager provides three preconfigured role personas and predefined permissions for common ML activities. These role personas are as follows:

  - Data scientist persona
  - MLOps persona
  - SageMaker AI compute persona

  For more information, see the following resources:

  - AWS IAM Identity Center
  - AWS IAM Access Analyzer
  - AWS Verified Access
  - Amazon Verified Permissions
  - Amazon SageMaker Role Manager
  - Ensure Least Privilege Access

- **Protect data from exfiltration (data theft) and manipulation**: For strong controls over data ingress and egress from AI systems, you can define strict AWS Network Firewall and Amazon VPC policies. This will prevent the movement of data in and out of your VPCs and networks. Here are some more services you can use to control data entering and leaving your AI systems:

  - AWS Network Firewall supports deep packet inspection to decrypt, inspect, and re-encrypt inbound and outbound TLS traffic to protect data. Data destined for the internet, another VPC, or another subnet is supported.
  - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) lets you launch AWS resources in a logically isolated virtual network that you've defined. This virtual network closely resembles a traditional network that you would operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
  - You can use AWS PrivateLink to establish private connectivity from your Amazon VPC to Amazon Bedrock, without having to expose your VPC to internet traffic.

  For more information, see the following resources:

  - AWS Network Firewall
  - Amazon Virtual Private Cloud
  - What is AWS PrivateLink?

- **Protect AI workloads with intelligent threat detection**: In addition to Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector and Amazon Detective can help with intelligent threat detection. These services help identify suspicious activity such as AWS credential exfiltration (theft) and suspicious user API usage, including Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker AI APIs. Following is a brief description of Amazon Inspector and Amazon Detective:

  - Amazon Inspector is an automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.
  - Amazon Detective streamlines the investigative process and helps security teams conduct faster and more effective forensic investigations.

  For more information, see the following resources:

  - Amazon Inspector
  - Amazon Detective

- **Automate incident response and compliance**: By automating security tasks on AWS, you can be more secure by reducing human configuration errors. This gives your team more time to focus on other work critical to your business. Task automation makes it more convenient for your security team to work closely with developer and operations teams to create and deploy code faster and more securely.

  For example, by employing technologies like ML, you can automatically and continuously discover, classify, and protect sensitive data in AWS.

  You can also automate infrastructure and application security checks to continually enforce your security and compliance controls and help ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability at all times.

  You can automate incident response and compliance with AWS services that you learned about earlier, such as the following:

  - AWS Security Hub
  - AWS Config
  - AWS Audit Manager
  - AWS Artifact

- **Defend your generative AI web applications and data**: In addition to AWS Shield Advanced and AWS Firewall Manager, which you learned about earlier, you can also use AWS WAF to protect your web applications and data.

  AWS WAF helps you protect against common web exploits and bots that can affect availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. With AWS WAF you can do the following:

  - Filter web traffic.
  - Prevent account takeover fraud.
  - Use AWS WAF Bot Control to control pervasive bot traffic (such as scrapers, scanners, crawlers). Pervasive bot traffic can consume excess resources, skew metrics, cause downtime, or perform other undesired activities. For more information, see AWS WAF Bot Control.

### What is the data engineering lifecycle?

The data engineering lifecycle is an iterative process where the data is collected, prepared, and analyzed. This data is then used to train, evaluate, and continuously improve the AI or generative AI models. This lifecycle ensures that the underlying data is of high quality, representative, and optimized for the specific AI or generative AI use case. Ultimately, this process contributes to the success and performance of the AI or generative AI systems.

![ data lifecycle](https://i.imgur.com/AkiI8VX.png)

- **1. Automation and access control**: Pipeline automation is an important part of modern data-centric architecture design. To successfully run your production system, it is recommended that you have a data pipeline.  The pipeline should have a start action, connecting steps, and a mechanism for separating failed and passed stages. It is also important to log failures while not hindering the rest of the extract, transform, and load (ETL) process. You can use AWS Glue workflows to create a pipeline.

- **2. Data collection**: This diagram shows how the data collection stage fits into the data engineering automation and access control lifecycle.

  AWS provides various data collection tools. Some of these tools include:

  - Amazon Kinesis
  - AWS Database Migration Service
  - AWS Glue

- **3. Data preparation and cleaning**: Data preparation and cleaning is one of the most important, yet most time-consuming, stages of the data lifecycle.
  If you have a large workload that has a variety of data, it is recommended that you use Amazon EMR or AWS Glue for your data preparation and cleaning tasks.

- **4. Data quality checks**: Data quality is an integral but often overlooked part of the data cleaning process.

  AWS provides data quality solutions based on your use case. These solutions are as follows:

  - AWS Glue DataBrew
  - AWS Glue Data Quality
