# **Responsible AI**

Responsible AI refers to practices and principles that ensure that AI systems are transparent and trustworthy while mitigating potential risks and negative outcomes. These responsible standards should be considered throughout the entire lifecycle of an AI application. This includes the initial design, development, deployment, monitoring, and evaluation phases.

![responsible ai](https://i.imgur.com/gUhwZY3.png)

- It is fully transparent and accountable, with monitoring and oversight mechanisms in place.
- It is managed by a leadership team accountable for responsible AI strategies.
- It is developed by teams with expertise in responsible AI principles and practices.
- It is built following responsible AI guidelines.

## What type of AI requires responsible AI?

Responsible AI is not exclusive to any one form of AI. It should be considered when you are building traditional or generative AI systems.

- **Traditional AI**: Traditional machine learning models perform tasks based on the data you provide. They can make predictions such as ranking, sentiment analysis, image classification, and more. However, each model can perform only one task. And to successfully do it, the model needs to be carefully trained on the data. As they train, they analyze the data and look for patterns. Then these models make a prediction based on these patterns.

  Some examples of traditional AI include recommendation engines, gaming, and voice assistance.

- **Generative AI**: Generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) runs on foundation models (FMs). These models are pre-trained on massive amounts of general domain data that is beyond your own data. They can perform multiple tasks. Based on user input, usually in the form of text called a prompt, the model actually generates content. This content comes from learning patterns and relationships that empower the model to predict the desired outcome.

  Some examples of generative AI include chatbots, code generation, and text and image generation.

## Generative AI offers business value

The potential of FMs is incredibly exciting. There are several FMs available, each with unique strengths and characteristics.

New architectures are expected to arise in the future, and this diversity of FMs will set off a wave of innovation. This stands to spark the following business values that companies can benefit from

- Creativity: Create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music.
- Productivity: Radically improve productivity across all lines of business, use cases, and industries.
- Connectivity: Connect and engage with customers and across organizations in new ways.

## Responsible AI Challenges in Traditional AI and Generative AI

### Biases in AI systems

- **Accuracy of models**: The number one problem that developers face in AI applications is accuracy. Both traditional and generative AI applications are powered by models that are trained on datasets. These models can make predictions or generate content based only on the data they are trained on. If they are not trained properly, you will get inaccurate results. Therefore, it is important to address bias and variance in your model.

  - **Bias**: Bias is one of the biggest challenges a developer faces in AI systems. Bias in a model means that the model is missing important features of the datasets. This means that the data is too basic. Bias is measured by the difference between the expected predictions of the model and the true values we are trying to predict. If the difference is narrow, then the model has low bias. If the difference is wide, then the model has a high bias.

    When a model has a high bias, it is underfitted. Underfitted means that the model is not capturing enough difference in the features of the data, and therefore, the model performs poorly on the training data.

  - **Variance**:Variance offers a different challenge for developers. Variance refers to the model's sensitivity to fluctuations or noise in the training data. The problem is that the model might consider noise in the data to be important in the output. When variance is high, the model becomes so familiar with the training data that it can make predictions with high accuracy. This is because it is capturing all the features of the data.

    However, when you introduce new data to the model, the model's accuracy drops. This is because the new data can have different features that the model is not trained on. This introduces the problem of overfitting. Overfitting is when model performs well on the training data but does not perform well on the evaluation data. This is because the model is memorizing the data it has seen and is unable to generalize to unseen examples.

### Bias-variance trade-off

Bias-variance tradeoff is when you optimize your model with the right balance between bias and variance. This means that you need to optimize your model so that it is not underfitted or overfitted. The goal is to achieve a trained model with the lowest bias and lowest variance tradeoff for a given data set.

![underfitted overfitted and balanced](https://i.imgur.com/iawpa6S.png)

- **Underfitted**: In the underfitted example, the bias is high and the variance is low. Here the regression is a straight line. This shows us that the model is underfitting the data because it is not capturing all the features of the data.
- **Overfitted**: In the overfitted example, bias is low and the variance is high. Here the regression curve perfectly fits the data. This means that it is capturing noise and is essentially memorizing the data. It won't perform well on new data.
- **Balanced**: In the balanced example, the bias is low and the variance is low. Here the regression is a curve. This is what you want. Its capturing enough features of the data, without capturing noise.

To help overcome bias and variance errors

- **Cross validation**: Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating ML models by training several ML models on subsets of the available input data and evaluating them on the complementary subset of the data. Cross-validation should be used to detect overfitting.
- **Increase data**: Add more data samples to increase the learning scope of the model.
- **Regularization**: Use regularization. Regularization is a method that penalizes extreme weight values to help prevent linear models from overfitting training data examples.
- **Simpler models**: Use simpler model architectures to help with overfitting. If the model is underfitting, the model might be too simple.
- **Dimension reduction (Principal component analysis)**: Apply dimension reduction. Dimension reduction is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that attempts to reduce the dimensionality (number of features) within a dataset while still retaining as much information as possible.
- **Stop training early**: End training early so that the model does not memorize the data.

## Challenges of generative AI

Just as generative AI has its unique set of benefits, it also has a unique set of challenges. Some of these challenges include toxicity, hallucinations, intellectual property, and plagiarism, and cheating.

- **Toxicity**: Toxicity is the possibility of generating content (whether it be text, images, or other modalities) that is offensive, disturbing, or otherwise inappropriate. This is a primary concern with generative AI. It is hard to even define and scope toxicity. The subjectivity involved in determining what constitutes toxic content is an additional challenge, and the boundary between restricting toxic content and censorship can be murky and dependent on context and culture.

  For example, should quotations that would be considered offensive out of context be suppressed if they are clearly labeled as quotations? What about opinions that might be offensive to some users but are clearly labeled as opinions?

  Technical challenges include offensive content that might be worded in a very subtle or indirect fashion, without the use of obviously inflammatory language.

- **Hallucinations**: Hallucinations are assertions or claims that sound plausible but are verifiably incorrect. Considering the next-word distribution sampling employed by large language models (LLMs), it is perhaps not surprising that in more objective or factual use cases, LLMs are susceptible to hallucinations.

  For example, a common phenomenon with current LLMs is creating nonexistent scientific citations. Suppose that an LLMs is prompted with the request, “Tell me about some papers by" a particular author. The model is not actually searching for legitimate citations but generating ones from the distribution of words associated with that author. The result might include realistic titles and topics in the area of the author. However, these might not be real articles, and they might include plausible coauthors but not actual ones.

- **Intellectual property**: Protecting intellectual property was a problem with early LLMs. This was because the LLMs had a tendency to occasionally produce text or code passages that were verbatim of parts of their training data, resulting in privacy and other concerns. But even improvements in this regard have not prevented reproductions of training content that are more ambiguous and nuanced.

  Consider this prompt for a generative image model, “Create a painting of a skateboarding cat in the style of Andy Warhol.” If the model is able to do so in a convincing yet still original manner because it was trained on actual Warhol images, objections to such mimicry might arise.

- **Plagiarism and cheating**: The creative capabilities of generative AI give rise to worries that it will be used to write college essays, writing samples for job applications, and other forms of cheating or illicit copying. Debates on this topic are happening at universities and many other institutions, and attitudes vary widely.

  Some are in favor of explicitly forbidding any use of generative AI in settings where content is being graded or evaluated, while others argue that educational practices must adapt to, and even embrace, the new technology. But the underlying challenge of verifying that a given piece of content was authored by a person is likely to present concerns in many contexts.

- **Disruption of the nature of work**: The proficiency with which generative AI is able to create compelling text and images, perform well on standardized tests, write entire articles on given topics, and successfully summarize or improve the grammar of provided articles has created some anxiety. There is a concern that some professions might be replaced or seriously disrupted by the technology.

  Although this might be premature, it does seem that generative AI will have a transformative effect on many aspects of work. It is possible that many tasks previously beyond automation could be delegated to machines.

## Core Dimensions of Responsible AI

The core dimensions of responsible AI include fairness, explainability, privacy and security, robustness, governance, transparency, safety, and controllability. No one dimension is a standalone goal for responsible AI. In fact, each topic should be considered as a required part for a complete implementation of responsible AI.

![core dimensions of responsible ai](https://i.imgur.com/GbPsIDL.png)

Topics is used in responsible AI

= **Fairness**: Fairness is crucial for developing responsible AI systems. With fairness, AI systems promote inclusion, prevent discrimination, uphold responsible values and legal norms, and build trust with society.

  You should consider fairness in your AI applications to create systems suitable and beneficial for all.

- **Explainability**: Explainability refers to the ability of an AI model to clearly explain or provide justification for its internal mechanisms and decisions so that it is understandable to humans.

  Humans must understand how models are making decisions and address any issues of bias, trust, or fairness.

- **Privacy and security**: Privacy and security in responsible AI refers to data that is protected from theft and exposure. More specifically, this means that at a privacy level, individuals control when and if their data can be used. At the security level, it verifies that no unauthorized systems or unauthorized users will have access to the individual’s data.

  When this is properly implemented and deployed in an AI system, users can trust that their data is not going to be compromised and used without their authorization.

- **Transparency**: Transparency communicates information about an AI system so stakeholders can make informed choices about their use of the system. Some of this information includes development processes, system capabilities, and limitations.

  It provides individuals, organizations, and stakeholders access to assess the fairness, robustness, and explainability of AI systems. They can identify and mitigate potential biases, reinforce responsible standards, and foster trust in the technology.

- **Veracity and robustness**: Veracity and robustness in AI refers to the mechanisms to ensure an AI system operates reliably, even with unexpected situations, uncertainty, and errors.

  The goal of veracity and robustness in responsible AI is to develop AI models that are resilient to changes in input parameters, data distributions, and external circumstances.

  This means that the AI model should retain reliability, accuracy, and safety in uncertain environments.

- **Governance**: Governance is a set of processes that are used to define, implement, and enforce responsible AI practices within an organization.

  Governance addresses various responsible, legal, or societal problems that enerative AI might invite.

  For example, governance policies can help to protect the rights of individuals to intellectual property. It can also be used to enforce compliance with laws and regulations. Governance is a vital component of responsible AI for an organization that seeks to incorporate responsible best practices.

- **Safety**: Safety in responsible AI refers to the development of algorithms, models, and systems in such a way that they are responsible, safe, and beneficial for individuals and society as a whole.

  This means that AI systems should be carefully designed and tested to avoid causing unintended harm to humans or the environment. Things like bias, misuse, and uncontrolled impacts need to be proactively considered.

- **Controllability**: Controllability in responsible AI refers to the ability to monitor and guide an AI system's behavior to align with human values and intent. It involves developing architectures that are controllable, so that any unintended issues can be managed and addressed.

  By ensuring controllability, responsible AI can help mitigate risks, promote fairness and transparency, and ensure that AI systems benefit society as a whole.

- **Regulatory compliance**: As AI regulations emerge, companies with robust ethical AI frameworks are better positioned to comply with guidelines on data privacy, fairness, accountability, and transparency.
- **Mitigating risks**: Responsible AI practices help mitigate risks such as bias, privacy violations, security breaches, and unintended negative impacts on society. This reduces legal liabilities and financial costs.
- **Competitive advantage**: Companies that prioritize responsible AI can differentiate themselves from competitors and gain a competitive edge, especially as consumer awareness of AI ethics grows.
- **Improved decision-making**: AI systems built with fairness, accountability, and transparency in mind are more reliable and less likely to produce biased or flawed outputs, which leads to better data-driven decisions.
- **Improved products and business**: Responsible AI encourages a diverse and inclusive approach to AI development. Because it draws on varied perspectives and experiences, it can drive more creative and innovative solutions.

## Responsible Considerations to Select a Model

Selecting a model is one of the first and most critical steps to developing an AI system. Model selection has strategic implications for how the AI system will perform. Everything from user experience and go-to-market to hiring and profitability can be affected by selecting the right model for your use case.

Remember that you can use Model evaluation on Amazon Bedrock or SageMaker AI Clarify to evaluate models for accuracy, robustness, toxicity, or nuanced content that requires human judgement.

---
[⬆️ Go to Context](#context)

### Define application use case narrowly

When selecting a model for your AI application, you must narrowly define your use case. This is important because you can tune your model for that specific use case.

**Example: Defining application use case narrowly for traditional AI**: In this example, you might have an AI application that uses face recognition. Face recognition is not a use case; it is a technology. The way your model applies that technology is a use case.

![application use case](https://i.imgur.com/1Zd9xnm.png)

For example, a gallery retrieval application might be used to help find missing persons. In this case, you would need a model that can be tuned for favor recall or precision. Favor recall would bring up many results that could be beneficial to the use case of the AI application used in finding missing persons.

However, if your AI application is being used for celebrity recognition or virtual proctoring, the model would only need to favor precision. This is because the favor recall tuning would provide too many results to be beneficial to the use case of the application.

**Example: Defining application use case narrowly for generative AI**: In this example, you might have an AI application to assist customers in shopping on your online store. The use case might be to provide a product catalog or to persuade customers to buy products. An appropriate model would need to be selected based on the narrowly defined use case.

| **Features**        | **Catalog a product**                        | **Persuade to buy**                                        |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Target audience** | Broad demographic                            | Narrow demographic                                         |
| **Possible issues** | Veracity                                     | Veracity, unwanted bias, toxicity, detail                  |
| **Consequences**    | Brand damage, lost sales, and returns        | Representative harm, brand damage, lost sales, and returns |
| **Tuning**          | Favors neutrality, clarity, and completeness | Focuses on highest interest problem and benefit to group   |

In an AI application to catalog a product, you would want a broad demographic target audience so that it is available for all of your customers.

In an AI application to persuade to buy, you would want a narrow target audience to capture a specific group of people. For example, you might want to target an audience that lives on the coast to buy accessories for docking boats.

### Choosing a model based on performance

Model performance varies across a number of factors, including the following:

- Level of customization – The ability to change a model’s output with new data ranging from prompt-based approaches to full model retraining
- Model size – The amount of information the model has learned as defined by parameter count
- Inference options – From self-managed deployment to API calls
- Licensing agreements – Some agreements can restrict or prohibit commercial use
- Context windows – The amount of information that can fit in a single prompt
- Latency – The amount of time it takes for a model to generate an output

- **Consider a model based on performance with test datasets**: A common mistake when choosing a model is to assume that the model, in and of itself, is either good or bad. This is not the case. Performance is a function of the model and a test dataset, not just the model. So, when you are assessing a model, you need to determine how well a model performs on a particular dataset.

![model that performs differently](https://i.imgur.com/aHE8lL4.png)

Model that performs differently on different datasets

For example, a model might perform well on test dataset A over a period of time. The model might perform even better on test dataset B. However, the model might progressively get worst on test dataset C.

This means that you need to consider two development trajectories: the development trajectory of the model and the development trajectory of the datasets. Remember the dataset is not necessarily constant. It is often evolving.

### Choosing a model based on sustainability concerns

Sustainability in the context of responsible AI refers to the ability of AI systems to be developed and deployed in a way that is socially, environmentally, and economically sustainable over the long term.

**Responsible agency considerations for selecting a model**: Responsible agency in responsible AI refers to an AI system's capacity to make good judgments and act in a socially responsible manner. The following are key aspects of moral agency for AI.

- **Value alignment**: Value alignment is being able to understand, evaluate, and make decisions based on moral principles rather than pure utility maximization. This requires value alignment between the AI system's goals and values and the responsible human values.
- **Responsible reasoning skills**: Responsible reasoning skills is being able to logically think through moral dilemmas and weigh various responsible considerations when making decisions. The AI needs logic and reasoning capabilities to apply responsible principles to novel situations.

  The AI system should have the capacity to engage in responsible reasoning and understand moral concepts, principles, and frameworks. It should be able to apply them in context to specific situations.

- **Appropriate level of autonomy**: The AI system should have the appropriate level of autonomy, with clear boundaries and mechanisms for human oversight and intervention, particularly in high-stakes or sensitive domains.
- **Transparency and accountability**: The AI system should be transparent about its decision-making process. It should allow external oversight and accountability to ensure its actions are responsibly justified.

Overall, responsible agency requires AI to have sophisticated intelligence on par with human-level cognition to properly apply ethical reasoning in the real world. This remains an immense challenge for current AI.

### Environmental considerations for selecting a model

When you are developing and deploying AI systems, use environmental considerations as you implement responsible AI.

The following are key environmental challenges and solutions to consider when choosing a model.

- **Energy consumption**

  |Challenge|Solution|
  |---|---|
  |Training large AI models and running them at scale can consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact.|The solution is to optimize energy efficiency in AI systems, use renewable energy sources where possible, and consider the overall carbon footprint of AI operations.|

- **Resources utilization**

  |Challenge|Solution|
  |---|---|
  |AI systems often require substantial computational resources, including specialized hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, and data center infrastructure. The manufacturing and disposal of these resources can have environmental impacts.|Responsible AI should aim to maximize resource efficiency, promote hardware reusability and recyclability, and minimize electronic waste.|

- **Environmental impact assessment**

  |Challenge|Solution|
  |---|---|
  |Before deploying AI systems, it is important to assess their potential environmental impacts, both direct (for example, energy consumption and resource usage) and indirect (for example, enabling or promoting environmentally harmful activities).|Environmental impact assessments should be conducted, and mitigation strategies should be implemented if necessary.|

**Economic considerations for selecting a model**: Economic considerations in responsible AI include the potential benefits and costs of AI technologies and the impact on jobs and the economy.

For example, AI can automate certain tasks and improve efficiency, but it can also lead to job displacement and inequality. Additionally, there are concerns about the concentration of power and data in the hands of a few companies, which could lead to monopolies and further inequality.

## Responsible Preparation for Datasets

An essential requirement of responsible AI is to prepare your datasets responsibly. This means that you need to have balanced datasets to train your models.

Remember that you can use SageMaker AI Clarify and SageMaker Data Wrangler to help balance your datasets.

### Balancing datasets

Balanced datasets are important for creating responsible AI models that do not unfairly discriminate or exhibit unwanted biases.

Balanced datasets should represent all groups of people or data topics. This means that the dataset should contain an adequate number of examples or instances of each group to ensure that the model is not biased towards any particular group or factor. The concept of balanced datasets is particularly important in applications like hiring, lending, or criminal justice, where fairness and equity are essential.

To achieve balanced datasets, the data collected needs to be inclusive and diverse, and the data also needs to be curated to optimize it for training.

- **Inclusive and diverse data collection**: Inclusiveness and diversity in data collection ensure that data collection processes are fair and unbiased. Data collection should accurately reflect the diverse perspectives and experiences required for the use case of the AI system. This includes a diverse range of sources, viewpoints, and demographics. By doing this, the AI system can work to ensure decisions are unbiased in their performance.

  For example, if an ML model is trained primarily on data from middle-aged individuals, it might be less accurate when making predictions involving younger and older people. Therefore, the datasets should be collected so that age groups are equally represented.

![example that shows bias towards middle-aged people](https://i.imgur.com/NpQu83l.png)

Inclusiveness and diversity in data collection is a primary concern for data that focuses on people. This is because alienating groups of people in the training data can lead to societal harms and legal repercussions. However, inclusiveness and diversity in data collection should be a primary focus regardless of the topic. For example, collection of data for people, scientific research, geography, weather, products, and other topics should be collected with a focus on the diverse range for each topic.

By promoting inclusiveness and diversity within AI, organizations can promote fairness, transparency, and accountability in their AI systems and contribute to the responsible development of AI technology.

- **Data curation**: The second part of balancing the datasets involves curation of the datasets. Curating datasets is the process of labeling, organizing, and preprocessing the data so that it can perform accurately on the model. The curation can help to ensure that the data is representative of the problem at hand and free of biases or other issues that can impact the accuracy of the AI model. Curation helps to ensure that AI models are trained and evaluated on high-quality, reliable data that is relevant to the task they are intended to perform.

  The main steps of curating data include data preprocessing, data augmentation, and regular auditing.

![steps of curating data](https://i.imgur.com/Cul0JyB.png)

- **Data preprocessing**: Preprocess the data to ensure it is accurate, complete, and unbiased. Techniques such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection can help to eliminate biases in the dataset.
- **Data augmentation**: Use data augmentation techniques to generate new instances of underrepresented groups. This can help to balance the dataset and prevent biases towards more represented groups.
- **Regular auditing**: Regularly audit the dataset to ensure it remains balanced and fair. Check for biases and take corrective actions if necessary.

**Balance your data for the intended use case**: The use case for the AI system will determine how the data needs to be balanced. For example, if you are creating an AI system about cancer in children, you would collect the data and curate it to focus on children and not include datasets on adults.

# **Transparent and Explainable AI Models**

To promote trust and accountability in an AI system, there should be transparency and explainability in the model.

## Models need to be transparent and explainable

**Transparency and explainability**: AI systems are now commonplace in many fields that impact business and society. Some of these fields include healthcare, security, and financial institutions. There must be trust and accountability in these AI systems. Therefore, including transparent and explainable models is fundamental for developing these AI systems.

Transparency answers the question HOW, and explainability answers the question WHY. Both aspects are needed to build responsible AI systems.

- **Transparency**: Transparency helps to understand HOW a model makes decisions.

  This helps to provide accountability and builds trust in the AI system. Transparency also makes auditing a system easier.

- **Explainability**: Explainability helps to understand WHY the model made the decision that it made. It gives insight into the limitations of a model.

  This helps developers with debugging and troubleshooting the model. It also allows users to make informed decisions on how to use the model.


**Transparent and explainable models compared to black box models**: Models that lack transparency and explainability are often referred to as black box models. These models use complex algorithms and numerous layers of neural networks to make predictions, but they do not provide insight into their internal workings.

Transparent and explainable models have several advantages over black box models.

- **Increased trust**: Transparent and explainable models can increase trust in the models and help users understand why the models are making certain predictions. This can be particularly important in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, financial services, and transportation, where it is crucial to understand the reasoning behind the models' decisions.
- **Easier to debug and optimize for improvements**: Transparent and explainable models can be easier to debug and improve than black box models. By providing insight into the models' internal workings, developers can identify issues and make targeted improvements to optimize the models' performance.

  In contrast, black box models can be more difficult to debug and improve because the internal workings of these models are not transparent. Developers might struggle to identify issues and make targeted improvements. This can lead to a longer development cycle and less optimal models.

- **Better understanding of the data and the model's decision-making process**: In terms of performance, transparent and explainable models might not always outperform black box models.

  However, they can provide a more comprehensive understanding of the data and the model's decision-making process. This can be particularly important in applications where explainability is a key consideration, such as in healthcare, where patients need to understand why a particular treatment was recommended.

- **Solutions for transparent and explainable models**: There is no standard solution for creating transparent and explainable models. Depending on the use case of the model, you might use different techniques.

Here are some potential solutions for increasing transparency and explainability in AI systems to help ensure responsible AI development.

- **Explainability frameworks**: There are several explainability frameworks available, such as SHapley Value Added (SHAP), Layout-Independent Matrix Factorization (LIME), and Counterfactual Explanations, that can help summarize and interpret the decisions made by AI systems. These frameworks can provide insights into the factors that influenced a particular decision and help assess the fairness and consistency of the AI system.
- **Transparent documentation**: Maintain clear and comprehensive documentation of the AI system's architecture, data sources, training processes, and underlying assumptions, which can be made available to relevant stakeholders and auditors.

  This can include user guides, technical documentation, and visualizations that help users understand the underlying algorithms and their inputs and outputs.

- **Monitoring and auditing**: AI systems should be monitored and audited to ensure that they are functioning as intended and not exhibiting bias or discriminatory behavior. This can include regular testing and oversight by humans and automated tools to identify unusual patterns or decisions.
- **Human oversight and involvement**: Incorporate human oversight and involvement in critical decision-making processes where humans can review and validate the AI system's outputs and decisions, especially in high-stakes situations.
- **Counterfactual explanations**: Provide counterfactual explanations that show how the output would change if certain input features were different to help users understand the model's behavior and reasoning.
- **User interface explanations**: Design user interfaces that provide clear and understandable explanations of the AI system's outputs, rationale, and limitations to end-users, so they can make informed decisions.

**Risks of transparent and explainable models**: Just as transparent and explainable models provide many advantages, they also come with some risks. Some of those risks include the following:

- Increasing the complexity of the development and maintenance of the model can increase the costs.
- Creating vulnerabilities of the model, data, and algorithms can be exploited by bad actors.
- Presenting unrealistic expectations that the model is perfectly transparent and explainable. In some situations, this may not be achievable or even intended.
- Providing too much information that can create privacy and security concerns. It could also lead to compromising the competitive edge of the model.

## Model Trade-Offs

### Interpretability trade-offs

Interpretability is a feature of model transparency. Interpretability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. This might sound a lot like explainability, but there is a distinction difference.

- **Interpretability**: Interpretability is the access into a system so that a human can interpret the model’s output based on the weights and features. For example, if a business wants high model transparency and wants to understand exactly why and how the model is generating predictions, they need to observe the inner mechanics of the AI/ML method.
- **Explainability** Explainability is how to take an ML model and explain the behavior in human terms. With complex models (for example, black boxes), you cannot fully understand how and why the inner mechanics impact the prediction. However, through model agnostic methods (for example, partial dependence plots, SHAP dependence plots, or surrogate models) you can discover meaning between input data attributions and model outputs. With that understanding, you can explain the nature and behavior of the AI/ML model.

![model's interpretability can affect performance](https://i.imgur.com/YTBAsQw.png)

If a business wants high model transparency and wants to understand exactly why and how the model is generating predictions, then they need a model that offers interpretability. However, high interpretability typically comes at the cost of performance, as seen in the diagram.

If a company wants to achieve high performance but still wants to have a general understanding of the model behavior, model explainability starts to play a larger role.

When starting a new AI/ML project, you need to consider whether interpretability is required. Model explainability can be used in any AI/ML use case, but if detailed transparency is required, then your AI/ML method selection becomes limited.

### Safety and transparency trade-offs

**Model safety**: Model safety is the ability of an AI system to avoid causing harm in its interactions with the world. This includes avoiding social harm, such as bias in decision-making algorithms, and avoiding privacy and security vulnerability exposures. Model safety is important for ensuring that AI systems are used in ways that benefit society and do not cause harm to individuals or groups.

**Model safety and model transparency trade-offs**:

- **Accuracy**: Complex models like large neural networks tend to be more accurate but less interpretable than simpler linear models, which are more transparent.
- **Privacy**: Privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy can improve safety but make models harder to inspect. This can make models less transparent.
- **Safety**: Constraining or filtering model outputs for safety can reduce transparency into the original model reasoning.
- **Security**: Highly secured air-gapped train models (models that are trained on networks that are private and do not have access to external data) might be less open to external auditing.

### Model controllability

**Model control**: A controllable model is one where you can influence the model's predictions and behavior by changing aspects of the training data. Higher controllability provides more transparency into the model and allows correcting undesired biases and outputs.

Model controllability is measured by how much control you have over the model by changing the input data. Models that are more controllable are easier to steer towards desired behaviors. This is important for fairness because you want to be able to understand and control bias in the model. Controllability of a model is also important for transparency and debugging in a model.

Controllability depends on the model architecture. Linear models tend to be more controllable than complex neural models. You can test for controllability by evaluating if manipulating the data, such as adding or removing examples, causes expected changes in the model's outputs and predictions. Controllability can be improved through data augmentation techniques and by adding constraints to the model training process.

Key aspects of designing for unbiased decision-making

By designing for unbiased decision-making, you can create more effective decision-making processes. Some of the key aspects to incorporate for designing for unbiased decision-making include transparency, fairness, and training.

- **Transparency**: Decision-making processes and tools should be designed in a way that is clear and accessible to all stakeholders. These processes should provide easy scrutiny and identification of potential biases. This can involve using data visualization techniques to make complex information more accessible and intuitive and providing clear explanations of the decision-making process and its implications.
- **Fairness**: Decision-making processes and tools should be designed to minimize unfairness and discrimination. They should help to ensure that all stakeholders have an equal opportunity to participate and influence the outcomes. This can involve designing decision-making processes that are inclusive of diverse perspectives and experiences. It also involves avoiding the use of biased criteria or metrics that might perpetuate stereotypes or biases.
- **Training**: Decision-makers, including policymakers, judges, and business leaders, need to be trained to recognize and mitigate biases. This can involve providing training to help decision-makers develop strategies for managing and overcoming biases.

### Reinforcement learning from human feedback

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is an ML technique that uses human feedback to optimize ML models to self-learn more efficiently. Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques train software to make decisions that maximize rewards, which makes their outcomes more accurate. RLHF incorporates human feedback in the rewards function, so the ML model can perform tasks aligned with human goals, wants, and needs. RLHF is used in both traditional AI and generative AI applications.

Some of the benefits of RLHF include the following:

- Enhances AI performance
- Supplies complex training parameters
- Increases user satisfaction

**Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth**: SageMaker Ground Truth offers the most comprehensive set of human-in-the-loop capabilities for incorporating human feedback across the ML lifecycle to improve model accuracy and relevancy. SageMaker Ground Truth includes a data annotator for RLHF capabilities. You can give direct feedback and guidance on output that a model has generated by ranking, classifying, or doing both for its responses for RL outcomes. The data, referred to as comparison and ranking data, is effectively a reward model or reward function that is then used to train the model. You can use comparison and ranking data to customize an existing model for your use case or to fine-tune a model that you build from scratch.
